For these, find our what are their RA, Decl. (J2000) and then precess their coordinates to 
the epoch of observations. Also derive (cf. Gaussian fitting), their x, y positions measured 
on the CCD frame. 

And then, try to find the most simple and accurate coordinate transformations between 
all these data (linear, quadratic, ...). Let us hope that :
RA - RA_0 = K_1 * (x-x_0),
Dec - Dec_0 = K_2 * (y-y_0)
will be the most adequate transformation. Please note that x might be replaced with y, 
but this is a detail.

Then see in the papers I have attached to which best projection in corresponds to (CAR???).

As I said before, the NODO data which are stored on aeos3 may be found in the folders:
/home/jeansurdej/NODO (for folders 14.48 ... 14.71, B, I, R, V, W) and
/home/jeansurdej/data1/NODO (for folders 14.72 ... 14.82)

The proposed plate solution would be valid if we were observing with a long and narrow CCD,
in one shot, which is not at all the case. It is more as if were were observing with a 1-D CCD,
oriented North-South.

In our case, the right ascension (RA) of a transiting object is thus equal to the local sidereal time (LST),
and since the latter runs continuously, we expect it to be linearly related the x position of the object
recorded on our long movies. Same for the declination (DE), it should be a linear function of the y
coordinate.

In an ideal world, we should have:
x - x_0 = f . (RA . cos(DE) - RA_0 . cos(DE_0)) and y - y_0 = g . (DE - DE_0),
with the parameters f and g (to be determined), being in principle a same and unique parameter
(i.e. f=g)

But the world is never ideal and I would rather expect (to be discussed) that perhaps, instead of
linear relations of the type:

RA . cos(DE) - RA_0 . cos(DE_0) = (x - x_0)/f  and DE - DE_0 = (y - y_0)/g,

and DE - DE_0 = (y - y_0)/g ,

we might have to deal with second order relations of the type
 
RA . cos(DE) - RA_0 . cos(DE_0) = (x - x_0)/f + h.(x - x_0)^2/f^2 + i (y-y_0)/g

and DE - DE_0 = (y - y_0)/g + j.(y - y_0)^2/g^2, and also with f .neq. g.

It could be that the relations will turn out to be more simple ... maybe more complicated.

Everyone should feel free to intervene ... and to carry out experiments with the data.

The only way to know which approach will be the best is to test the different types 
of relations and see what works the best.
